## CHANGELOG

<details>
   <summary> [v0.06] - 2023-05-02  </summary> <br />

   **Added:**
   - Main game folder w/ necessary assets, scripts, etc

   ⚠️ **WARNING: PLEASE READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING**
   1. Once you download the main folder, go into the **Assets** folder and unzip **Firebase_Assets.rar** in the same folder and **DELETE IT AFTERWARDS**.
      - This contains the necessary assets for Firebase to work with the project

   2. General Warning: I really have no clue if this folder will be compatible with other machines so **TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK**

   **KNOWN BUGS TO WORK ON**
   1. Killing an enemy with the sword equipped causes more loot to drop than it should

   2. Wall colliders work with the player, but not with the enemies (likely due to RigidBody2D complications)

   3. Animations on the enemy are a bit wonky, mostly due to the animation trigger points occasionally overriding themselves
   
   4. When walking, the player seems to jitter, causing the walking animation to become blurry
